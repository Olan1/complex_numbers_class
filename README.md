# complex_numbers_class

<p>A complex number is denoted by a real and imaginary component. The imaginary
unit is usually represented by i (or sometimes j), where:</p>
<p>
                            i = sqrt(-1)
</p><p>                       
                            i^2 = -1
</p><p>
A complex number is usually expressed in the form:
</p><p>    
                            a + bi
</p><p>                            
Where a is the real component and b is the imaginary component. Complex numbers
have many applications such as allowing for solutions to all polynomial
equations. Complex numbers can be represented as a 2 dimensional vector with
(1, i) as its standard basis. This is a cartezian coordinate system, known as
a complex plane. This allows for geometric representations of complex numbers.
Complex numbers can be added, subtracted, multiplied and divided. Like all
vectors, they have magnitude which can be calculated using:</p>
<p>    
                        M = sqrt(a^2 + b^2)
</p><p>                        
Where M is magnitude, a is the real component and b is the imaginary component.
The complex conjugate of a complex number has an equal real component, and an
imaginary component of equal magnitude but with the opposite sign.
This programme will use the object oriented programming (OOP) paradigm to
design a Complex class which will create complex numbers from the input of 2
numbers representing the real and imaginary components. The class will
construct instances of the complex numbers, perform addition, subtraction,
multiplication, and division on the complex numbers. It will also have
functions to set and get the real and imaginary components, as well as functions
to calculate the complex conjugate and magnitude of the complex number, and a
function to check if 2 complex numbers have equal component values.</p>
